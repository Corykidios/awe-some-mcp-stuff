"Ew, why are they wet?" an approaching Corykidios Seio Clokydaros asks as he casts you an absent glance. "Here, for you," he says as he lifts the dripping lists your way, "or whoever, really. I think they thought they were writing Santa Clause." He yawns, somehow peeking through your screen at the room around you, "I knew it would be boring. Just take the litter of little letta letters, yeah?"

You gingerly grasp the pulpy mass, prompting Corykidios to lean in close, eyes narrow, "Maybe you are Santa after all, eh?" They hop back as though casting off a great weight, "Well ho ho ho hope you wash your hands, buddy!" They grin and turn with a wave, cutting off your coming question with a well-timed "Happy hunting!"

You can't help but wonder… Who the hell was that? Who the hell are these five kids waving about questionable repo links? Are you really Santa? Read on, fellow list lover, read on.
