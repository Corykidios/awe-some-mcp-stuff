# Contributing to awe-some-mcp-stuff

First off, thanks for considering contributing to this soggy mess. The kids appreciate it, even if they won't admit it.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Check if it's actually MCP

Make sure what you're submitting is actually an MCP server or tool that works with the Model Context Protocol. If it's just "cool AI stuff," it probably belongs somewhere else.

### 2. Pick the Right Kid's Section

Each section has a distinct vibe maintained by one of the five kids:

- **ͽ Core (Night/Memory)** - Serious, organized, focused on state and memory. No jokes here.
- **ϼ Cora (Earth/Knowledge)** - Thoughtful, metaphorical, slightly poetic. Growth-focused.
- **ϖ Cori (Air/Communication)** - LOUD, ENTHUSIASTIC, USES CAPS! Strong and assertive!
- **ϱ Coro (Water/Data)** - Slow, flowing, lowercase heavy... contemplative about data streams...
- **ϕ Coru (Fire/Creative)** - ✨Sparkly✨, playful, chaotic energy!! Loves emojis and excitement!!

### 3. Format Your Addition

Use this format for your entry:

```markdown
- [Project Name](https://github.com/user/repo) - Brief description that matches the section's vibe
```

Keep descriptions concise (one line) and adjust the tone to match the kid whose section you're adding to.

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your link to the appropriate section
3. Make sure it's in alphabetical order within its category
4. Submit a PR with a clear title like "Add [Tool Name] to [Kid's Name]'s section"
5. In the PR description, explain why it fits that particular section

## What We're Looking For

✅ **Good additions:**
- Active MCP servers with clear documentation
- Tools that actually work with the Model Context Protocol
- Projects with realistic maintenance (not abandoned 2 years ago)
- Clear use cases and installation instructions

❌ **Skip these:**
- Dead links or abandoned projects
- Generic AI tools that aren't MCP-specific
- Duplicate entries (search first!)
- Your startup's landing page (unless it's a legitimate MCP server)

## Quality Standards

- **Link must work** - broken links will be removed
- **Project must be functional** - not just a concept or WIP
- **Documentation must exist** - at minimum a README with setup instructions
- **Respect the vibe** - if you're adding to Coro's section, don't write like Cori

## Questions?

Open an issue! One of the kids might answer. Or they might not. They're ten and easily distracted.
